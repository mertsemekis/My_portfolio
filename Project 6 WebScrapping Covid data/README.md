<h1> Project 6 WebScrapping Covid data
</h1>

<p> At this project I extracted the data from the website <a href='https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/'>worldmeter.com</a> using the libraries request and bs4 (BeautifulSoup).</p>
<p> I created a DataFrame named covid_df with these data and I cleaned it, because the data were not saved properly. </p>
<p> At the end I created the columns PercentInfected, PercentDeaths and PercentRecovered and I created some visualizations. </p>
