In this project I downloaded the survey results, which was conducted by StackOverflow. I used the data of this survey, to find what technologies, programming languages and databases are being used by the developers/professionals of the data analysis field.
 I analysed the answers just for those who selected Data or business analyst, Data scientist or machine learning specialist and Engineer-data for their current job.
 <p>
 My goal was to understand the tools, the programming languages and databases that are mainly used by the professionals of Data Analysis Field.</p>
<p>According to this survey the developers/professionals in this field are mainly men (91%), aged between 25 to 34 years old (50%) and they prefer using Python(16%) and SQL (10%).</p>
<p>Moreover, they have worked with databases such as PostgreSQL (17%), MySQL (16%) and SQLite (13.5%).
Their favorite libraries/Frameworks are NumPy, Pandas and TensorFlow with percentages 22%, 20% and 13% respectively.
Finally, 41% of them have used the Git tool and they prefer using either Windows (37%) or Linux (36%) as their primary operating system.</p>
